## General Info
This HabitTracker helps you to keep track of activities you choose to track. The program was developed as part of a university project (B.Sc. Data Science). 

The app enables you to integrate positive, mindful habits in your daily life and receive a positive affirmation by completing habit streaks. The habits are assigned to the predefined categories "health", "mindfulness", and "fun". You can create a user profile, select habits from a predefined list as well as create your own habits. You are able to not only track your activities but also see what your current and longest streaks are.
